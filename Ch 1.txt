There was a little girl named Gwen. She was a marvel!
She loved to study and learn new things.
But she had no one to talk to as everyone she knew believed in some rumours.
She was happy that her parents knew the truth and so she got even more attached to them.

She felt sad when kids of her age would ignore her pleas to be a part of their team.
Hours would pass as she silently watched them play and have fun.
