There was a little girl named Gwen. She was a marvel!
She loved to study and learn new things.
But she had no one to talk to as everyone she knew believed in some rumours.
She was happy that her parents knew the truth and so she got even more attached to them.

She felt sad when kids of her age would ignore her pleas to be a part of their team.
Hours would pass as she silently watched them play and have fun.

She knew her birthday was a few days away.But she wasn't that excited as she used to be.
She just wanted to go to a new place and start afresh.
A place where no one knew her.
She knew she was nice and that if no one had heard about whatever ill rumours was spread 
about her, she'll make some really great friends.
