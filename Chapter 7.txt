When she was about 13 years old, she had a nightmare...
She saw herself talking to the devil in the exact same spot she used to talk to herself every single day!

A few days leter,she had another dream that she was dead and no one even noticed that she was lying there.Everyone just stamped upon her, spit on her and threw waste
on her! She tried to help herself in the dream,but couldn't!When she woke up,she felt very eerie.

Realization dawned upon her that frequent talking to herself was making her insane.
She wanted a solution and an idea sparked in her brain!...She could start writing a diary!

She searched the entire house for a diary and found a brand new one! But she thought it would be better to ask her mom before taking it for herself.

Her mom permitted her and she started jotting everything down in her diary.She stopped getting those nightmares and felt more saneful.
