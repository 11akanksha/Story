The kids had to let her in and she was very happy.
Unfortunately,her happiness was short lived.
She realised no one actually wanted her to be there.
They stared at her manacingly and stopped playing as soon as her mom went away.
Silently standing in the middle of a circle created by the kids,Gwen gave a faint smile.

"Hello , everyone.My name is Gwen!"

"We know that loser!" - one boy named Henry mocked.

"Why do you all hate me?"

"Cause we know who you really are!" - Kenith replied cruely.

"I'm just a normal girl,trying to make friends.What's wrong in that?"

Everyone stood silently and kept grinning at her!
