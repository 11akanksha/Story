"Your dad is coming home early today!"

"Yayy!!...Can I please ask dad to shift us away to a new place mom?"

"You may,but only when I signal you to do so.If he is in a bad mood,it's better not to mention anything about shifting"

Gwen sat waiting for her dad,with her fingers crossed.

....

Soon her dad arrived and as usual,Gwen rushed to meet him.She was overly excited to meet him,which her dad thought was a bit fishy.

"What's the matter with her?"- her dad asked his wife.

"Oh..It's nothing darling...you go and freshen up.The dinner is ready!"

Gwen hugged her mom from behind and looked at her with tears in her eyes.

"Wait...let him freshen up...Where are your manners Gwen!?"

Gwen silently and slowly went to her room upstairs and sat crying on her bed.

After what seemed like forever,her mom finally entered her room and told her that she has discussed with her dad,but it was not possible to shift till atleast a month!

"That is a long long time mom!" - Gwen cried and thumbed her wrist on her bed and fell face down on her pillow.

"Hey hon'.Will you please serve me more soy sauce?.This one is empty."

"Yeah...Coming." Her mom kissed Gwen on her arm and went away.Gwen lost all her hopes and believed that she'll have to stay there forever.

...

The next day her mom took her to the playgound visible from her window and asked other kids to let her in.
