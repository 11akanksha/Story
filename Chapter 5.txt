Mark allowed her to leave ,which triggered Kenith to push him .

"Have you lost your mind?"
"What wrong has she ever done?"
"Why don't you just go with the flow?"
"But...We shouldn't treat her like that."

"Did you fall in love with her Mark!?" - Stacey scoffed.

"Not at all!"

The conversation ended there and they continued their game.
After a few hours,it started getting dark and they decided to go home.

Mark knew that Gwen lived near by and planned to give her a visit.He had no idea that the next day was her birthday.
He walked straight up to her house but hesitated to knock on the door.
"Are you looking for me?" -A voice asked from behind one of the trees.

He quickly turned around and saw a vortex!

"Who is this? Is that you,Gwen?" - Mark shouted over the loud noise that no one else seemed to notice.

"Yes" - answered an electronic voice.

"No...I know its NOT her!!"
The vortex started sucking him in!

Mark wanted to escape ,but he couldn't move a muscle!
"Help me...Please!!" - He tried to say,but was unable to even open his mouth!

He went to another dimension! All alone with some mystical creatures!

"You shouldn't have come here!" - said the electronic voice.

Mark was suspended in mid air in what seemed like a void.Everything was pitch black and he couldn't see a thing.
