Suddenly her mom came upto her and asked her if she wants anything for her birthday.

"I just want some friends of my age , mom " - She cried.
"Go and play with them...Comeon!"
"But they won't let me in"
"I'll go and talk to them"
"No mom...No use...They hate me!"
"What wrong have you done?"
"Exactly!!..I don't even know half of them!"
"Come on...They will surely love letting you in!Maybe you are not asking right enough"
"Ok mom...you give a try.Maybe they will listen to you.They just ignore me!"
