Suddenly her mom came upto her and asked her if she wants anything for her birthday.

"I just want some friends of my age , mom " - She cried.
"Go and play with them...Comeon!"
"Mom,I have a plan.Can we just shift to some new place?"
"But,what's the matter? Don't give up so soon,honey."
"But mom!!I had literally begged them to be my friend the other day!
All they did was laugh at me!Am I so bad?"

"Not at all my darling!...You are so well-behaved,down-to-earth girl"
"Then why does everyone hate me?"
"I don't know!...But I cannot promise we'll be able to shift to a new place or not"
"But mom..."
"It's not easy...Wait,your dad is calling"

Her mom rushed outside Gwen's room to grab her mobile.
