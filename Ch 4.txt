Suddenly one of the boys changed his smile to a more friendly one and asked
her if she wants to be a part of a new team that he was about to create.

"Sure...I'd love to!"

Everyone glared at the boy with gritted teeth and occasionally peeked at Gwen.

"Listen Mark! If you wanna be with her and feel bad for her, then you need to choose.
It's either her or us!" - snapped Stacey.

Mark thought for a while and decided to stay with his original group.

"But...then ,what about me? " - asked poor Gwen.

"Silly bitch! You thought he would take ya?"
And everyone burst out in utter laughter, as Gwen started crying and tried to exit the
human chain of circle surrounding her.They kept pushing her towards the center.

Everyone except Mark.
