Her continued writing in her diary made her writing skills imporve a great deal.She went into literature and started writing novels.
She became a very empathetic,independent,caring and peace loving person.

When she was around 25yrs, she became the most popular writer of all times and won various awards and trophies.

Many people wanted to be her friend now...She got loads of friend request every hour...But she could not trust anyone.She accepted most of them.
In her heart of hearts she knew her best friend will always be her mother.


This was the story of Gwen.
Please don't be rude to anyone.First find out the truth and don't blindly trust on rumours.
The person you might be accussing may be a completely different person all together.She/He might never have commited any sins,but are yet punished every single day!
Give them a chance...They may prove to be your most invaluable friend ever!!
